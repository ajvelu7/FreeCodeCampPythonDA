# FreeCodeCamp Python Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains my solutions to the Python Data Analysis projects from FreeCodeCamp. The projects demonstrate various data analysis techniques, including data wrangling, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

## Project Descriptions
1. **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator**
   - Implements basic statistical functions.
   - Computes mean, variance, and standard deviation from a 3x3 matrix.

2. **Demographic Data Analyzer**
   - Reads demographic data and performs statistical analysis using Pandas.
   - Finds percentage of people with different education levels.

3. **Medical Data Visualizer**
   - Visualizes medical dataset trends with matplotlib and seaborn.

4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer**
   - Analyzes and visualizes a time series dataset.

5. **Sea Level Predictor**
   - Predicts future sea levels using linear regression.
